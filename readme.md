# Content based recommendation model.

*Recommend the similar product*

This method is based on the concept that users may like product which is similar to the product they just purchased.

For example, When we watch a movie in netflix, the recommender of netflix will look for a movie in it's database to find movies that are close to the watched ones(such as having same actor or the same genre).

This model doesn't require other user's data, so it can be applied without data collection period.
